## Build from source

Prereqs: Node 18+ (or 20+)

```bash
# clone
git clone https://github.com/ZENTCH-Q/Deep-Canvas.git
cd Deep-Canvas

# dev
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Plugin SDK

Create custom widgets by dropping JavaScript files into `app/plugins`.
Each plugin exports a `register(api)` function. Use `api.registerWidget`
to add buttons to the canvas dock.

```js
// app/plugins/hello-plugin.js
export function register(api) {
  api.registerWidget({
    id: 'helloPlugin',
    label: 'Hello',
    html: '👋',
    onClick: () => alert('Hello from plugin!')
  });
}
```

Restart the app to load new plugins.
